**What is Microblading?**

Microblading is the process of implanting color pigment beneath the surface of the skin by means of a small, sterile, disposable needle to produce the appearance of a fuller eyebrow or to enhance the natural features of the face. 

**How long does Microblading last?**

The treatment is considered semi-permanent and will not wash off; however, it will fade over time and may require a touch up every 6 months-two years. Frequency of touch-ups depends on a number of factors including: the pigment color used (lighter colors fade faster), lifestyle (sun exposure), iron deficiency (your body absorbs iron-oxide as a supplement), and if any chemical peels come into contact with the treated areas. Please note that final results cannot be guaranteed as each unique skin type will hold pigments differently and break down at different rates.  The tattooed hair strokes tend to have a more crisp look once healed on dry skin compared to more blurry strokes on oily skin. 
Touch-ups are normal for cosmetic tattoo procedures.  The initial procedure is followed by a touch-up appointment 6-8 weeks later.

**Can I get my eyebrows Microbladed if they were previously tattooed?**

This is up to Colleen’s discretion,  and she should approve your eyebrows before your initial appointment if they are tattooed, previously tattooed eyebrows may not produce good results from Microblading.  

**How many treatments are needed?**

Two treatments are usually needed, at least 6 weeks apart. With most procedures, the color looks dramatically lighter after the first week. Some clients prefer this, while others opt for a bolder look. At the second treatment, we will assess the color retention and make adjustments as necessary. Everyone heals differently and at different rates. If your cosmetic tattoo does not heal perfectly the first time, do not worry! We can always go darker and add more density at your next appointment. I like to ease clients into the look of their new eyebrows, so taking our time over these two appointments to get the color and density perfect is my greatest priority.  
How will I look immediately after? What is the healing process?
Your semi-permanent makeup will appear darker and bigger than expected for the first few days. This will gradually lighten during the complete healing process. Please view the detailed aftercare. 
Can I get tattooed if I'm pregnant or nursing?
As a precaution to avoid any complications, I do not perform cosmetic tattooing on pregnant or nursing women.

**How old do I need to be get tattooed?**

You must be 18 years old to get Microblading.

**How can I book an appointment?**

While appointments may be reserved online through our website and the Vagaro app, we do require a $100 non refundable deposit to reserve your appointment. We ask that you please call the studio to make this deposit as well as have any questions you may have answered before you book.”
