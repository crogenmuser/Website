**What to do or avoid before your microblading appointment:**

- If you normally get your eyebrows waxed or threaded to maintain the shape, you may get them shaped 3 days prior to your microblading appointment.
- If you would like your artist to use as much hair as possible, you may let your eyebrows grow until your microblading appointment. 
- Avoid tanning two weeks prior to your microblading appointment.
- Do NOT come to your microblading appointment with a sunburn on your forehead or flaking skin around your eyebrows. In this case, email your artist at least 48 hours prior to your appointment to reschedule.
- Avoid chemical peels at least 4 weeks prior to your microblading appointment.
- Avoid Botox and Fillers at least two weeks before and two weeks after your appointment. 
- Avoid alcohol, ibuprofen or any medication that thins the blood 24 hours prior to your microblading appointment.‚Äù
