    <p>
        Colleen is the owner and sole artist at Color Theory Cosmetic Tattoo.  
        <br>
        She graduated from The University of the Sciences in 2008 with a degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences, 
        including courses in Cosmetic Science.  
        After college, Colleen worked in quality control laboratories, 
        performing color testing for various cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.  
        After a few years of this work, 
        she decided that she wanted to be less behind the scenes and working more with people one on one. 
        This led her to obtain her Esthetician license in 2012 from the Aveda Institute at Jean Madeline.   
        <br>
        After several years specializing in makeup artistry, skincare, and eyebrow shaping, 
        Colleen obtained her Microblading certification in December of 2016 and has been loving every minute of this work ever since.   
        She will soon be adding a certification in Scalp Micropigmentation to her list of services offered at Color Theory Cosmetic Studio.
